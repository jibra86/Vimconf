" Basic Setup:

" Enter the current millenium
set nocompatible
set relativenumber
set noerrorbells
set tabstop=4 softtabstop=4
set shiftwidth=4
set expandtab
set smartindent
set nu
set nowrap
set nobackup
set undodir=~/.vim/undodir
set undofile
set incsearch
set cursorline
set autoindent

set colorcolumn=80
highlight ColorColumn ctermbg=0 guibg=lightgray

" Enable Syntax and plugins (for netrw)
syntax enable
filetype plugin on

" Finding Files:

" Search down into subfolders
" Provides tab-completion for all file-related tasks
set path+=**

" Display all matching files when tab complete
set wildmenu

" NOW WE CAN:
" - Hit tab to :find by partial match
" - Use * to make in fuzzy

" To list all the files that were opened in vim
" and are now stored in memory
" :ls to list all the files opened in vim

" THINGS TO CONSIDER:
" - :b lets you autocomplete any open buffer

" TAG JUMPING:

" Create the `tags` file (may need to install ctags first)
command! MakeTags !ctags -R .

" NOW WE CAN:
" - Use ^] to jump to tags under the cursor
" - Use g^] for ambiguous tags
" - Use ^t to jump back up the tag stack

" THINGS TO CONSIDER:
" - This doesn't help if you want a visual list of tags

" AUTOCOMPLETE:

" The good stuff is Documented in |ins-completion|

" HIGHLIGHTS:
" - ^x^n for JUST this file
" - ^x^f for filenames (work with our path trick!)
" - ^x^] for tags only
" - ^n for anything specified by the 'complete' option

" NOW WE CAN:
" - Use ^n and ^p to go back and forth in the suggestion list

" The Leader Key:
let mapleader = " "
let g:netrw_browse_split = 2
let g:netrw_banner = 0
let g:netrw_winsize = 25

" FILE BROWSING:
let g:netrw_banner=0        " disable annoying banner
let g:netrw_browse_split=4  " open in prior window
let g:netrw_altv=1          " open splits to the right
let g:netrw_liststyle=3     " tree view
let g:netrw_list_hide=netrw_gitignore#Hide()
let g:netrw_list_hide.=',\(^\|\s\s\)\zs\.\S\+'

" NOW WE CAN:
" - :edit a folder to open a file browser
" - <CR>/v/t to open in an h-split/v-split/tab
" - check |netrw-browse-maps| for more mappings

" SNIPPETS:

" Read an empty HTML template and move cursor to title
nnoremap ,html :-1read $HOME/.vim/.skeleton.html<CR>3jwf>a

" NOW WE CAN:
" - Take over the world
" - (with much fewer keystrokes)

" KEYMAPS:
